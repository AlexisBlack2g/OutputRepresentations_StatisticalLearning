Input syllables were digitally recorded at a sampling rate of 44,100 and 16-bit depth with a head-mounted AKG C520 microphone and USB Pre 2 preamp through Audacity 2.0 in a sound-proofed booth. Syllables were produced by a trained phonetician (the first author) and recorded in a single session. Syllables that were deemed acoustically clearest and most similar in duration, intonation, and timing were selected and manipulated via the Vocal Toolkit plug-in (Corretge, 2012) in Praat (Boersma & Weenink, 2012). Syllable durations were set to 220 milliseconds (as in a number of previous SL paradigms, e.g., Saffran, et al., 1996; French et al., 2011; Mersad & Nazzi, 2012). To achieve this, syllables were first hand-spliced so that their natural intensity contour resembled the shape of a target syllable (bi).  The proportion of voicelessness/voicing to vowel duration was examined, and either lengthened or shortened by hand to approximate the target syllable. Proportions differed for voiceless and voiced consonant onsets: voiced consonant proportions of the syllable ranged from 14-18%; voiceless consonant proportions ranged from 15-25%. Individual glottal pulses and sections of aspiration were either removed or copied and pasted in order to (respectively) shorten or lengthen consonant proportions. In both cases, sections were selected such that the waveform began and ended at a zero-crossing, to avoid the introduction of acoustic artifacts. The function Change Duration from Vocal Toolkit, which uses the PSOLA resynthesis method, was next applied to create a syllable of exactly 220 msec. Then, the Copy function was employed to ensure similar F0 medians (178 Hz), F0 contours, and intensity contours across syllables (see Figure 2.1).  Finally, the Scale Intensity function of base Praat was used to set mean RMS amplitude to 70 dB.
